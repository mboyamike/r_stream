# r_stream

This is a flutter application to demonstrate the working of video player. 

## Getting Started

This project uses firebase for authentication. The APK can be downloaded under
releases in this repository.
Since I could not place the google-services.json file on a public repository 
(security reasons), if you would like to compile it you would have to create 
a firebase project, enable authentication and download the 
google-services.json file. After placing the file in the android/app 
directory, the project should compile without further changes.
